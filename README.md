# Buggy Extension

## Design purpose
We are computer science students who are suffered from searching for the same questions multiple time. We need a handful extension to easily record our bug and the corresponding solution from a website(i.e. stackoverflow). This extension should provide basic function such as store website title including the description of a bug. Also, it should provide a label that properly categorize the bug. Moreover, it provides a searching function that streamline the learning process.

## Development Guide



```
npm run build
webpack
```

Load the `/build` folder to the extension page.
